    "#   The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\n",
    "# software and other kinds of works.\n",
    "\n",
    "#   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\n",
    "# to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\n",
    "# the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\n",
    "# share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\n",
    "# software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\n",
    "# GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\n",
    "# any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\n",
    "# your programs, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "#   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n",
    "# price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n",
    "# have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n",
    "# them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\n",
    "# want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\n",
    "# free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n",
    "\n",
    "#   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\n",
    "# these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\n",
    "# certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\n",
    "# you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n",
    "\n",
    "#   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\n",
    "# gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\n",
    "# freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\n",
    "# or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\n",
    "# know their rights.\n",
    "\n",
    "#   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n",
    "# (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\n",
    "# giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#   For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\n",
    "# that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\n",
    "# authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\n",
    "# changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\n",
    "# authors of previous versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\n",
    "# modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\n",
    "# can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\n",
    "# protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\n",
    "# pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\n",
    "# use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\n",
    "# have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\n",
    "# products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\n",
    "# stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\n",
    "# of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n",
    "\n",
    "#   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\n",
    "# States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\n",
    "# software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\n",
    "# avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\n",
    "# make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\n",
